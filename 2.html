<h2>the Prisoner of Azkaban</h2>
<p>This is my first HTML study for creating web pages about <a href="https://www.wizardingworld.com/" target="blank" title="the official home"><u><strong>Harry Potter</strong></u></a>.<p><img src="harry potter.jpg" width="50%"></p></p><p>
  Harry Potter was a highly unusual boy in many ways. For one thing, he hated the summer
  holidays more than any other time of year. For another, he really wanted to do his homework but
  was forced to do it in secret, in the dead of night. And he also happened to be a wizard.
   It was nearly midnight, and he was lying on his stomach in bed, the blankets drawn right over his
  head like a tent, a flashlight in one hand and a large leather-bound book (A History of Magic by
  Bathilda Bagshot) propped open against the pillow. Harry moved the tip of his eagle-feather quill
  down the page, frowning as he looked for something that would help him write his essay, ‘Witch
  Burning in the Fourteenth Century Was Completely Pointless — discuss.’
