<h2>Philosopher's Stone</h2>
<p>This is my first HTML study for creating web pages about <a href="https://www.wizardingworld.com/" target="blank" title="the official home"><u><strong>Harry Potter</strong></u></a>.<p><img src="harry potter.jpg" width="50%"></p></p><p>
  Mr and Mrs Dursley, of number four, Privet Drive, were proud to
  say that they were perfectly normal, thank you very much. They
  were the last people you’d expect to be involved in anything
  strange or mysterious, because they just didn’t hold with such
  nonsense.
  Mr Dursley was the director of a firm called Grunnings, which
  made drills. He was a big, beefy man with hardly any neck,
  although he did have a very large moustache. Mrs Dursley was
  thin and blonde and had nearly twice the usual amount of neck,
  which came in very useful as she spent so much of her time craning
  over garden fences, spying on the neighbours. The Dursleys had a
  small son called Dudley and in their opinion there was no finer
  boy anywhere. </p>
